# Next steps

Already [completed the tutorial](getting-started-tutorial-1.md)? Ready to build your own app or library, or just want to learn more? These resources will help you on your way.

* Check out some code examples:

    * The [Uno Gallery and Playground](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno.Playground) showcases many of the UI controls supported by Uno.

    * With [Uno Calculator](https://calculator.platform.uno/) we took Microsoft's open-sourced Windows 10 Calculator, ported it to C#, and put it on Android, iOS, and WebAssembly. [Check out all the code here.](https://github.com/unoplatform/calculator)

    * [Uno Azure DevOps (UADO)](https://github.com/unoplatform/uado) is our reference app, built from the ground up for Uno.

* The Uno Platform brings Microsoft's UWP framework to Android, iOS, and WebAssembly. The wealth of [official Microsoft documentation on the UWP framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/develop/) is a great place to start, particularly if you've never used UWP or Xaml before.

* To find out more about cross-platform development with Uno, consult the rest of the docs here, including a list of [supported features](supported-features.md) and [general development tips](using-uno-ui.md).

* If you have a question about Uno that others might benefit from, post it on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=uno-platform) using the 'uno-platform' tag. Remember to check if the question [already exists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/uno-platform) and to follow StackOverflow's [question guidelines](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). You'll need to sign up to StackOverflow if you're not signed up already.

* If you think you've encountered a bug (e.g., something works on UWP but not on another platform), [check for an existing issue on GitHub](https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/issues) and create one if none exists. We don't like bugs, but we do like bug reports!

* If you're ready to contributing to Uno, great! Check out our guides on [building Uno](uno-development/debugging-uno-ui.md) and [creating UI samples](uno-development/working-with-the-samples-apps.md).
