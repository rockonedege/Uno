## Current behavior

<!-- Describe how the issue manifests. -->

## Expected behavior

<!-- Describe what the desired behavior would be. -->

## How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)

<!-- 
Please provide a **MINIMAL REPRO PROJECT** and the **STEPS TO REPRODUCE**

To create a minimal reproduction project:
 - Create an Uno app through:
   - `dotnet new --install Uno.ProjectTemplates.Dotnet` and `dotnet new unoapp`
   - or through the [Visual Studio extension](https://platform.uno/docs/articles/get-started-vs.html)
 - Make sure to add the least code possible to demonstrate the issue
 - Keep all project heads, even if the platforms are seemingly not relevant to your issue
 - Remove all the `obj/bin` folders and zip the folder.
 - Attach the zip file to the issue

If the issue is visible on WebAssembly and uses only XAML:
- Visit https://playground.platform.uno
- Add your code and data context as needed
- Create a link and paste it here

## Workaround

<!-- Please provide steps to workaround this problem if possible -->

## Works on UWP/WinUI
<!--
Yes / No

To make sure this is an Uno Platform specific issue, try running your sample application 
on Windows using the UWP or WinUI project. If it does not work on Windows either, it may be a 

Windows issue or it may be a documentation issue. In this case, open a discussion instead:
